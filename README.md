# 💫 About Me:
👋 About Me<br><br>Hi, I’m Fardoos — a 22-year-old Software Engineer graduated from Aarhus University 🎓<br><br>I have a strong interest in modern software development and enjoy working across both frontend and backend. My primary stack includes C#/.NET, React, TypeScript, and Node.js, and I’m particularly motivated by building scalable, well-structured solutions where architecture, performance, and long-term maintainability matter 🚀<br><br>Through my experience at Bankdata (Cloud Center of Excellence) and Railmonitor, I’ve worked in production-oriented environments with Azure ☁️, CI/CD pipelines, Infrastructure as Code, API design, and full-stack development. I’ve gained hands-on experience turning complex technical requirements into practical solutions that create real business value.<br><br>I thrive in environments where ownership, collaboration, and continuous improvement are part of the culture 🤝 I enjoy contributing to technical discussions, improving existing systems, and writing code that is not only functional — but clean, structured, and scalable over time.<br><br>Beyond the technical side, I bring positive energy, structure, and a proactive mindset ⚡ I enjoy solving complex problems, working in teams, and continuously developing both my technical and professional skills.<br><br>I’m always curious, always building, and always looking to improve 📈
